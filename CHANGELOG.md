# Change Log

- Initial release

## 1.0.1
- Removed debug startup message

## 1.0.2
- Fix XSS exempt plugin config variable

## 1.0.3
- Update indentation rules for HTML.
- The `file` attribute of `{include}` will autocomplete if the current file includes `/templates/` in itâ€™s page.
- Add `{literal}` tag autocompletion.

## 1.0.4
- Only decrease indent if closing tag is on it's own line. This prevents `{/if}` from decreasing the indent in this code:

	</div>
</div>
```

- Decrease indent after `foreachelse`.
- Don't indent after open/close on the same line.
	- E.g. `<th></th>` will no longer indent after it.
